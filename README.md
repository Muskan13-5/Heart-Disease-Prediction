# Project Description
## Problem Statement
The main objective of this project is to predict the likelyhood of heart disease based on various factors such as age, sex, cholestrol level, etc. Few Machine Learning techniques are explored for the model.
## Dataset Used
The dataset which we have used is taken from kaggle.  
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci
## Software/ Tools used:
Jupyter Notebook
## Libraries used:
1.Numpy  
2.Pandas  
3. Matplotlib   
4. Seaborn   
## Procedure:
1. Identify the problem and data sources.  
2. Data Pre-processing.  
3. Data Modelling.  
4. Model Evaluation.  
# Algorithms Used:
## Logistic Regression:
Logistic regression is a supervised learning classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a target variable. The nature of target or dependent variable is dichotomous, which means there would be only two possible classes.
## Naive Bayes:
Na√Øve Bayes algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on Bayes theorem and used for solving classification problems.It is a probabilistic classifier, which means it predicts on the basis of the probability of an object.
## Suppirt Vector Machine (SVM):
SVM divides the data into two classes by a line, if the margin is more it means classes are better separated, and if there are more than two classes the line is replaced by a hyperplane.
